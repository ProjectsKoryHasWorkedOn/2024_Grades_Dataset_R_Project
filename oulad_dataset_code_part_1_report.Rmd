# OALAD dataset

## Looking at the entire dataset

I found that Excel did not read the .csv data right (e.g. In studentInfo.csv, for the 'imd_band' column, the % for the student with a student_ID of 74372 was shown as Oct-20) unless I loaded the .csv data into Excel via Data > Get Data > From File / CSV. 

From looking at the data, I thought that it would be best to make some changes to it. The first change I made was making the meaning of the column names clear [based on the homepage of the dataset](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset). The second change I made was setting ambigious values to NA (e.g. "age 55 <=" to NA)


Should make a new weightedScore column, which is derived from 'weight' times by 'score'


Should consider dropping columns that have a lot of (> 50%) missing values
